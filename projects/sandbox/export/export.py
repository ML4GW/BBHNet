    Export a BBHNet architecture to a model repository
    for streaming inference, including adding a model
    for caching input snapshot state on the server.

    Args:
        architecture:
            A function which takes as input a number of witness
            channels and returns an instantiated torch `Module`
            which represents a DeepClean network architecture
        repository_directory:
            Directory to which to save the models and their
            configs
        outdir:
            Path to save logs. If `weights` is `None`, this
            directory is assumed to contain a file `"weights.pt"`.
        num_ifos:
            The number of interferometers contained along the
            channel dimension used to train BBHNet
        kernel_length:
            The length, in seconds, of the input to DeepClean
        inference_sampling_rate:
            The rate at which kernels are sampled from the
            h(t) timeseries. This, along with the `sample_rate`,
            dictates the size of the update expected at the
            snapshotter model
        sample_rate:
            Rate at which the input kernel has been sampled, in Hz
        weights:
            Path to a set of trained weights with which to
            initialize the network architecture. If left as
            `None`, a file called `"weights.pt"` will be looked
            for in the `output_directory`.
        streams_per_gpu:
            The number of snapshot states to host per GPU during
            inference
        instances:
            The number of concurrent execution instances of the
            BBHNet architecture to host per GPU during inference
        platform:
            The backend framework platform used to host the
            DeepClean architecture on the inference service. Right
            now only `"onnxruntime_onnx"` is supported.
        clean:
            Whether to clear the repository directory before starting
            export
        verbose:
            If set, log at `DEBUG` verbosity, otherwise log at
            `INFO` verbosity.
