    For a sequence of background segments, compute a discrete
    distribution of integrated neural network outputs using
    the indicated integration window length for each of the
    normalization window lengths specified. Iterates through
    the background segments in order and tries to find as
    many time-shifts available for each segment as possible
    in the specified data directory, stopping iteration through
    segments once a maximum number of seconds of bacgkround have
    been generated.
    As a warning, there's a fair amount of asynchronous execution
    going on in this function, and it may come off a bit complex.
    Args:
        thread_ex:
            An `AsyncExecutor` that maintains a thread pool
            for writing analyzed segments in parallel with
            the analysis processes themselves.
        process_ex:
            An `AsyncExecutor` that maintains a process pool
            for loading and integrating Segments of neural
            network outputs.
        pbar:
            A `rich.progress.Progress` object for keeping
            track of the progress of each of the various
            subtasks.
        background_segments:
            The `Segment` objects to use for building a
            background distribution. `data_dir` will be
            searched for all time-shifts of each segment
            for parallel analysis. Once `max_tb` seconds
            worth of background have been generated, iteration
            through this array will be terminated, so segments
            should be ordered by some level of "importance",
            since it's likely that segments near the back of the
            array won't be analyzed for lower values of `max_tb`.
        data_dir:
            Directory containing timeslide root directories,
            which will be mined for time-shifts of each `Segment`
            in `background_segments`. If a time-shift doesn't exist
            for a given `Segment`, the time-shift is ignored.
        write_dir:
            Root directory to which to write integrated NN outputs.
            For each time-shift analyzed and normalization window
            length specified in `norm_seconds`, results will be
            written to a subdirectory
            `write_dir / "norm-seconds.{norm}" / shift`, which
            will be created if it does not exist.
        max_tb:
            The maximum number of seconds of background data
            to analyze for each value of `norm_seconds` before
            new segments to shift and analyze are no longer sought.
            However, because we use _every_ time-shift for each
            segment we iterate through, its possible that each
            background distribution will utilize slightly more
            than this value.
        window_length:
            The length of the integration window to use
            for analysis in seconds.
        t_clust:
            Timescale over which to cluster integrated network outputs
    Returns:
        A dictionary mapping each value in `norm_seconds` to
            an associated `ClusterDistribution` characterizing
            its background distribution.

    """Analyze injections in a directory of timeslides

    Iterate through a directory of timeslides analyzing known
    injections for false alarm rates in units of yrs$^{-1}$ as
    a function of the time after the event trigger times enters
    the neural network's input kernel. For each event and normalization
    period specified by `norm_seconds`, use time- shifted data from
    segments _before_ the event's segment tobuild up a background
    distribution of the output of matched filters of length `window_length`,
    normalized by the mean and standard deviation of the previous
    `norm_seconds` worth of data, until the effective time analyzed
    is equal to `max_tb`.
    The results of this analysis will be written to two csv files,
    one of which will contain the latency and false alaram rates
    for each of the events and normalization windows, and the other
    of which will contain the bins and counts for the background
    distributions used to calculate each of these false alarm rates.
    Args:
        data_dir: Path to directory containing timeslides and injections
        write_dir: Path to directory to which to write matched filter outputs
        results_dir:
            Path to directory to which to write analysis logs and
            summary csvs for analyzed events and their corresponding
            background distributions.
        window_length:
            Length of time, in seconds, over which to average
            neural network outputs for matched filter analysis
        t_clust: Clustering timescale for background distributions
        norm_seconds:
            Length of time, in seconds, over which to compute a moving
            "background" used to normalize the averaged neural network
            outputs. More specifically, the matched filter output at each
            point in time will be the average over the last `window_length`
            seconds, normalized by the mean and standard deviation of the
            previous `norm_seconds` seconds. If left as `None`, no
            normalization will be performed. Otherwise, should be specified
            as an iterable to compute multiple different normalization values
            for each event.
        max_tb:
            The maximum number of time-shifted background data to analyze
            per event, in seconds
        force:
            Flag indicating whether to force an event analysis to re-run
            if its data already exists in the summary files written to
            `results_dir`.
        log_file:
            A filename to write logs to. If left as `None`, logs will only
            be printed to stdout
        verbose:
            Flag indicating whether to log at level `INFO` (if set)
            or `DEBUG` (if not set)
